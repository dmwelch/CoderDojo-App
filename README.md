CoderDojo
=========

This app is an app to track progress of CoderDojo participants. It
tracks points, badges (or belts) and gives somewhere for people to
show off projects. 

Note

Remember to copy application/config/database.sample.php to 
applcation/config/database.php. This is so that people don't overwrite
other's database configs when they push
